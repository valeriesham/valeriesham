## ðŸš€ About Me

:woman_technologist: I am Valerie Shamshyna, a **Fullstack Software Developer**. I started my journey within this field in the beginning of 2023 when I decided to attend a coding bootcamp called **Hack Reactor**. I graduated from Hack Reactor on August 11th, 2023 and since then I have continued learning and improving my skills on my own. 

ðŸŒ± Currently, I am working on my first post-bootcamp project which will be an e-commerce website built in **Django**. I am also going through the Harvard CS50 **computer science fundamentals** course on EdX, searching for a coding volunteering opportunity, and planning to start contributing to open source projects in the very near future. 

:camping: In my free time outside of coding, I love to spend time in nature, read, go to dance classes, go on bicycle rides, and cook. 

:bike: Aside from finishing Hack Reactor, my biggest achievement in life was being a part of bicycle ride across the United States from NYC to San Francisco as part of a student organization Illini 4000. As a result of our ride, we raised over $130,000 for cancer charities as a team!

:airplane: My next planned adventure is going to Mexico for two months starting in October to volunteer at a local animal shelter (while continuing to code the whole time throughout of course :wink:).

:exclamation: NOTE: During my time at Hack Reactor, the students were required to use GitLab for all of our projects. As a result, all of my Hack Reactor projects are housed there and can be found through this **[link](https://gitlab.com/valeriesham)**. However, now I am planning to use GitHub for my future projects and contributions :)
